    <h2>Git</h2>
    <p>Git is free <strong>open source software</strong> (the <a href="https://github.com/git/git">source code is
        public</a>) written by Linus Torvalds who also wrote the Linux operating system's kernel. </p>
    <p>Git is a program for keeping track of changes over time, known in programming as <strong>version control</strong>.
        If you've used a track changes feature in a text editing software then you're already familiar with the concept!

    <h3>Configure Git</h3>
    <p>Open your <strong>terminal</strong>.
        You can verify that Git is installed by typing:</p>

    <p><code class="shell">git --version </code></p>

    <p>This will return the version of Git on your computer and look something like this:</p>

    <p><code class="comment">git version 1.9.1</code></p>

    <p>Next, configure Git so it knows to associate your work to you:</p>
    <p>Set your name:</p>
    <p><code class="shell">git config --global user.name "Your Name"</code></p>
    <p>Now set your email:</p>
    <p><code class="shell">git config --global user.email "youremail@example.com"</code></p>

    <h3>Dollar Signs in Code Documentation</h3>
    <p>Dollar signs <code>$</code> are often used in programming documentation to signify that the line is <strong>command
        line</strong> code (see the code snippets above). You don't actually type the <code>$</code> in though, only
        type what comes after.</p>
