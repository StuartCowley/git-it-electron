    <h2>Repositories</h2>
    <p>A <strong>repository</strong> is a collection of related items. In our case, when writing software, it is a
        collection of files related to a software project. You can imagine it as a project folder with all the relevant
        files inside of it. In fact, that's what it will look like on your computer anyways. Sometimes they're called
        "repos" for short.</p>

    <img src="../../../assets/imgs/repos.png" alt="A drawing of four file folders" width="600">

    <p>You tell Git what your project is and Git will start tracking all of the changes to that folder. This makes it a
        Git repository: a folder of items being tracked by Git. Git tracks when files are added, subtracted or even a
        single letter in a single file is changed. All of this plus who did it and when is tracked by Git. In software,
        tracking changes like this is called <strong>version control</strong>.</p>

    <h2>Using Terminal</h2>
    <p><strong>Terminal</strong> (or Bash) is a way to instruct your computer to do things by typing commands rather
        than clicking applications with your mouse. You can rename files, open files, create new folders, move between
        directories (folders) and more all by running typed commands.</p>

    <p>Besides navigating your computer, you can also use programs in Terminal that have a <strong>command-line
        interface (CLI)</strong>, meaning they can be run with commands in terminal. Git is one of these. The first part
        of the command lets your computer know you're talking to Git. The parts following that are the commands and the
        different options you want Git to act on.</p>

    <p>In this tutorial you'll learn a few basic command-line actions (in addition to Git commands) for navigating your
        computer; they're described within the steps.</p>

    <h3>Create a Repository</h3>
    <p>You're going to create a new project folder and then initialize it as a Git repository. We'll name the folder 'hello-world'
      in this challenge, but you can choose a different name if you already have a folder named this (it's a common first project name).</p>

    <p>Time to open your terminal!
    <p>

    <p>In your terminal window, type these commands, one at a time, pressing enter/return after each.</p>

    <p>Firstly, let's make a new folder for all of our projects we'll do on the course:<br><span class="inline-tip">Tip: mkdir stands for <em>make directory</em></span></p>
    <code class="shell">mkdir Projects</code>

    <p>Then go into that folder:<br><span class="inline-tip">Tip: cd stands for <em>change directory</em></span></p>
    <code class="shell">cd Projects</code>

    <p>Make a new folder for the project:</p>
    <code class="shell">mkdir hello-world</code>

    <p>Then go into that folder:</p>
    <code class="shell">cd hello-world</code>

    <p>Finally, tell Git to initialize (start tracking) the folder you are now in:</p>
    <code class="shell">git init</code>

    <p>The last command should return something starting with "Initialized empty Git repository". The others commands do
        not return anything.</p>

    <p>You did it! If you want to be double-sure that it's a Git repository, type <code>git status</code> and if it
        doesn't return 'fatal: Not a git repository...', you're golden!</p>

    <h3>Initialising a Git repository in the correct folder</h3>
    <p>One of the most common mistakes among students when first starting out with Git, is to initialise their Git repository (<code class="shell">git init</code>) inside their home folder (<code class="shell">~</code>) or their Projects folder.</p>
    <p>Always ensure you only initialize a new repository inside a single project folder so each project has its own repository.</p>
